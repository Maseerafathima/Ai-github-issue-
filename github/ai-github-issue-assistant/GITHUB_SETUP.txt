# Setup instructions for pushing to GitHub
# Since git CLI is not available, follow these steps:

# 1. Go to https://github.com/new
# 2. Create a new repository named: ai-github-issue-assistant
# 3. Keep it public
# 4. Do NOT add README, .gitignore, or license (we have our own)

# 5. Once created, you'll see instructions. In this project directory, run:
#    - Install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win (if not installed)
#    - Then run these commands:

# git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-github-issue-assistant.git
# git branch -M main
# git push -u origin main

# Or push via:
# 1. Use GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/)
# 2. Click "Add Local Repository" 
# 3. Select this folder
# 4. Publish to GitHub

# The repository is ready to be pushed!
